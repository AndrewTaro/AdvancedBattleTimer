AutoSpy, who no longer plays World of Warships, developed the original concept of this mod.  
My project is a complete rewrite from scratch, with bug fixes and more options.

# Features
- Animations for Battle Start Countdown
- Support for Drag & Drop
- Customizable Font Size
- Adjustable Background Panel

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!

# Requirements
You must install the following in order to use the mod.
- [TTaro Mod Config](../../../TTaroModConfig)
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)
